SUBJECT 16

We dost detect the presence of accursed Thrynn aboard thy vessel. We wouldst have no dealings with thee, friends of our enemies.
Our investigations reveal that thou art friends of the evil Thrynn. Therefore art thou enemies of the Elowan.
Thou hast done a deed most unthinkably foul. Thou hast destroyed Elan, the sacred planet of our young and thereby hast thou all but destroyed the Elowan. Truly art thou more vile even than the Thrynn. We are now and forever mortal enemies.
Scanners of ours show that thou hast 20 Arth units at least. Thy need does not seem dire. Thou would'st speak falsely and take advantage on us.
We give unto thee, friends of the Elowan, 15 Arth units of fuel.
Is thine need for energy dire?

SUBJECT 15
We must now take our leave. Fare thee well friends.We now depart.

SUBJECT 14
Art thou friends or allies of the Thrynn?Hast thou or thine ever partaken of headfruit?Art thou and the Institute of old in any way affiliated?Was not Arth a Noah colony?Hast thou to the dead zone been, and the ruins of old Earth seen?

SUBJECT 13
Thou art wise in thy peaceful dealings, for the path to knowledge doth lie therein. Were that all races were minded so.Again we are as we once were with those few of your kind, allies in the cause of truth and the search for wisdom. This is as it should be, is it not.Forsake us not for the terrible Thrynn. You can but only lose for doing this.Pray, do not listen to such things as the Thrynn might say of us. 'Tis naught but empty slander.Forsooth, we can detect the presence of Thrynn, and they us, for we are the fiercest of enemies. Do not understand me wrongly, they alone are the aggressors.If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert, or else of thee this I prognosticate. Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.We ask only that you commit neither violence nor tresspass against us. In return we offer much.In sooth are concepts akin to organisms, for do they not require time for growth and cultivation, and do we not breed them for beauty and for productivity. Let us exchange concepts that we may bring new vitality to our minds.

SUBJECT 11
The Ancient Ones, who are no more, are the oldest of all races. Little do we know of them but for the songs of the Minstrels. 'Twas from another galaxy, far distant, that they came, or so it is sung.If the Minstrel songs be true the span of an Ancient One's life was measured not in years, but rather in millenium, so long-lived were they.The Velox, in their boastful pride, lay claim to be descendants of the Ancient Ones. Heed not such conceitful folly.For every race that is possessed of some slight knowledge of the Ancient Ones there is another theory to explain their nature. Perhaps only the Delasa'alia know the face of truth.Mayhap none have known more of the Ancient Ones than the Institute of the Old Empire of Earth. But alack, with the fall of the Empire the knowledge was lost, for none, not even we, knew the location of its final hiding place among the stars.'Tis not known whether any Ancient Ones survive still. Mayhap only that heinous legacy, the Crystal Planet, has been left us. Its evil task is to destroy all that lives. Why, we know not.Upon approaching the Crystal Planet it doth unleash a mighty force, so take care. Only the possession of a certain device will stay this. The nature of this device was perchance known to those of the Institute, but it is unbeknownst to us.'Tis known to us that upon the Crystal Planet there is one place only that is vulnerable to attack. Oft have we tried and failed, for even this nexus of control is all but impregnable.If thou wouldst make attack upon the ancient planet of crystal firstly must thou find the nexus of control. To do this thou wouldst require that which is lost, the cone of crystal fashioned by the Ancient Ones.

SUBJECT 10
'Twas in 2770 that the Empire did discover our home system of Eleran. Contact first was made with the wretched Thrynn. Therefore were we not at first accepted as sentient for they spoke wrongly of us and were not questioned in their slander.When Thrynn and Elowan first were taken into the Empire the Thrynn nurtured a profane seed. The sale of headfruit on the black market quick became a tenacious weed that survived to the final days of the Empire.

SUBJECT 9
The sun of the planet thou call'st Arth shall flare in the final week of your ten-month of this year, so we have ascertained.Akteron, Gaal, Iridani, and Echt. These are the suns of the four seedlings, a constellation in our demesne oft used as a landmark by our people.Coreward does the dead-zone lie. In this region no living thing shalt thou find, for the Crystal Planet has passed here and left naught behind.Outward of the dead-zone lies the zone intermediate. Here the Crystal Planet orbits, completing its task ere it moves on.

SUBJECT 8
Place not your trust in the Thrynn, for they are not what they would appear to be and would do thee harm should they be given chance to do so.The culture of the Thrynn embraces the machine. They are advanced and yet within them thou wilt great ignorance find, for they know not even that in nine-month of this year their sun shall flare, nor shall we, who bear them no great love, tell them.Constant and fierce have been the attacks of the vile Thrynn, e'er since the Empire fell and could no longer judge them.Know thee this, that the homeworlds of all races are well guarded and thither thou mayest not descend. Even if thou art friends will they not suffer thee to violate that final bastion. Well has this lesson been learn'd by all races.Interesting indeed are the ancient Veloxi, for they are possessed of both great wisdom and great ignorance. In matters of the Ancients their arrogance breeds false wisdom.Meeting thee has been no small surprise, for 'twas our belief that the colony worlds of the Empire had'st been destroyed all heretofore.The Spemin knowest little and mostly do they bluster. Upon pampering shalt thou appease them, but that which is useful shalt thou gain'st only by force.Strongest of many races are the Uhlek, and as well the Gazurtoid, who have fled the wave of flaring suns. In sooth, only those who are strongest have survived.Longer than any other race have the Uhlek fled. From the center of the galaxy they have come hither, and so shall they continue, for with the passage of each 100 score years they again journey outward.The Uhlek are a race like none other. As if cells of one large creature, autonomous yet one, they are possessed of a single mind which resides apart from them, buried deep in subterranian caverns.So long have the Gazurtoid been travelling outward they have forgotten why they must migrate. They know only that they are on a holy crusade.Expect little from the Gazurtoid for they offer little. Waste not your time in vain effort to learn from them.The Uhlek speak only with their weapons. 'Tis our thought that thou would'st not care much for what they have to say.The wandering creatures of space have been called by many 'the Minstrels', and by some 'Delasa'alia'. They are old beyond counting and wise in like measure.The Minstrels, alone of all races, require no vessel in the depths of space. Only do they wander and sing of what was. Little do we know of that which lies within the hearts of the Delasa'alia.

SUBJECT 7
It is with the theory of science that we are, ourselves concern'd, and such things as may be called beauty and perhaps truth.Now but few of us remain, for the sun's flare did our second homeworld destroy, and as well are we preyed upon by the Thrynn, relentless and cold.At a time when we doth reach an age of adolescence we are uprooted. In so doing we are become omniverous producers until that time when again we must root, whereupon our heads into flowers turn and we reproduce.Mayhap one of every 300 of our number doth stay rooted within the ground, and in so doing is its head then transformed into a melon-like fruit called headfruit wherein lie the many seeds of our future.Headfruit is of all things, to us, most dear. Upon claiming that it dost bestow greater intelligence and increase the span of life do the sly Thrynn thieve and consume this fruit. So have we been enemies, and so shall we always be.No other planet is so sacred as Elan. For there dost our young abide, and in tranquility dwell. Not even those of us grown disturb their meditations there. An island world, with oceans vast and splendorous, Elan revolves about the yellow sun of 148,63.Is not violence, above all things, most base and vile? Surely only as a final measure, and even then with reservation, can it be condoned.The star of our birth was also that of the Thrynn. Together there we dwelt as they do still, till we fled hither, lest they destroy us at last.The orange star of our birth, at 129,33, was named Eleran, and by the Thrynn Thoss. And upon the second planet did we dwell, and they upon the fourth.As our young play often do they sing songs such as this - someday to the ground will fall, Iridani, Echt, and Gaal. Up they'll grow with branches tall, then to Akteron they'll call. And at last it too will fall. The brightest seedling of them all.

SUBJECT 6
What sayest thou?I wait on thy answer.

SUBJECT 5
Pray forgive me, but I know little of such things. Perhaps you might ask this of another.

SUBJECT 2
Greetings and felicitations most grand, friends of the Elowan. We wouldst help thee in any way we can. Pray, how might we be of service?We offer felicitations most sincere. Thou art well met, and welcome here.We extend to thee the vine of friendship. If thou wouldst have it so, we would share with thee what we know.We are Elowan. If thine intentions be peaceful in sooth, we greet thee. If not, we request that thou leavest us who bear thee no ill will.We are Elowan, and above all else do we cherish peace. If thou art of like mind we welcome thee.We entreat thee from violence refrain, for nothing more do we disdain, and in so doing all that we might gain, would be forever lost, like tears in rain.

SUBJECT 1
Hail to thee and well met are we. Thou art welcome, friends of the Elowan.Again we are met and haply so. Unto thee we offer what small wisdom we have acquired. What say you?In friendship we greet thee, fellow travellers of eternal night. Fear not the Elowan who seek that which thou dost also, the light of knowledge and the peace of understanding.Hail and welcome. 'Tis our request that thee identify thyself forthwith. We are Elowan and would have peace between us.Statest thou thine intentions and name thyself. We greet thee in peace if thou greetest us in like measure. We are Elowan, and we bear thee no malice.Hail. Art thou friends or foe of the Elowan? We ask thee in friendship and would have it be thus between us. The choice is thine.

SUBJECT 5
And lo, unto them it was said 'shall ye go forth and cleanseth the galaxy of the accursed breathers of air.'Reflect upon thyself and be appalled! For art thou not the accursed abomination? And so shall I raiseth my tentacle and smite thee!Fear not vile air breathers, for in death shalst thou findeth redemption, and I am thy redeemer!It is written 'thou who breathest not liquid but rather air shall perish in the flames of holy righteousness'. Look unto me and repent for I am the carrier of the flame and thy time is at hand.Also is it written 'only to the Uhlek, thy holy vanguard shalt thou show sufference. Yea! Suffer not other air breathers and idolaters in thy righteous path, for thou art the Gazurtoid, the holy crusaders.And Blulbgrb begat Urgglbb who begat Glbrrgb who begat Lubrbglb who begat Bulgrb. Thereby was the begatting begun.Into the firey reaches went the chosen one of the Gazurtoid and there did he see that no liquid but only air was breathed. And upon returning to the liquid realm did he then proclaim that air breathers were truly the most vile and heinous of creatures.And out of dark nothingness was created the water breather, and lo, he was bored. Then next was the air breather created and unto the water breather was it commanded 'thou shalt persecute him and thereby shalt thy boredom be vanquished.'And unto him came the divine revelation. 'Thou shalt buildeth a vessel and it shall be 8 million tentacle lengths round, and thou shalt go forth into the vastness of space and so shall ye spread my word, and with love commitest mass genocide in my name.

SUBJECT 2
Repent, air breathers! Repent! The hour of judgement is at hand!I am Gazurtoid and I have come to save thee, ye who breathest not glorious liquid. Drop thy defenses and be saved!Yea! And unto the Heavenly realm I send thee. For I am the tentacle of righteousness and I shall smite thee with love!Fight us not, infidel air-breathers. We are Gazurtoid, your last hope of redemption.

We do not detect the presence of any human lifeforms aboard your vessel. We therefore conclude you cannot be Group 9.

SUBJECT 15
Now terminating communications.

SUBJECT 14
Our scanners show that your vessel is derived from Empire technology. Do you confirm?Are you Group 9?Heaven awaits. Are you prepared?Do you serve Layton?We have waited long for Noah, shall we continue to do so?Is it your desire that we maintain code blue?Do you verify code red?Are you an enemy of Noah?Are you ready to take your place in the brave new world?

SUBJECT 13
Our data banks are at your disposal.We have waited long for you Group 9.You have been delayed. We were not programmed for this contingency.We must verify.Warning. We are programmed to repel invaders. Leave immediately or be destroyed.This is Empire space. You must leave at once.Invaders depart immediately.

SUBJECT 11
You will be destroyed.We will answer no questions.Endurium was first discovered in some ancient ruins on Sol-4 in 2100.The strange crystalline lumps of endurium are always found in ancient ruins.Ruins of the Ancients have been found all over space, but primarily seem to be in m-type systems. They are many hundreds of millions of years old.The Institute, based at 75S x 66E on Akteron 6 studied the Ancients intensely. There was much controversy surrounding their findings. They often worked with the Elowan.In the Empire there were several popular theories about the Ancients. One was that they travelled the universe seeding life and leaving endurium. Another belief is that they will one day return to judge mankind.It is believed that the device known as the Crystal Planet was built by the Ancients.There have long been rumors that somewhere in a nebula in Spemin space is a vast city of the Ancients. It is thought to be on the innermost planet of the system.We have discovered some ruins at 36N x 90E on the ice planet in our system.

SUBJECT 10
This is the final warning.We will answer no questions.The first wave of attacks on the Empire was by the Numlox and Phlegmak and started in 3000. The second wave, comprised of Uhlek and Gazurtoid, started in 3400. Both came from coreward.As of the time of our departure there was an 84 percent certainty factor that the Numlox and Phlegmak races had been completely destroyed by the Empire.Your presence here indicates the Empire has survived. At the time of our departure the probability of this was very low.During the wars with the Phlegmak many worlds of the Empire were destroyed by their black-egg planet bombs.The entire economy of the Empire is based on endurium. When we left, the richest and strongest planet was New Scotland, the second planet in the upspin end of the Staff constellation.When we left, the Empire was divided into many factions. One of these was headed by Layton. The laytonites believed the Empire was evil and should die. They are enemies of project Noah. They are our enemies.Empire morale was broken in 3440 when the offensive headquarters on Mardan-2 were destroyed by the Uhlek.The Institute has an underground station on Earth at 12N x 104W.The Empire utilizes drones called Nomads in their preliminary explorations. These collect life and mineral data on planets which may prove to be suitable for colonization.

SUBJECT 9
Cease communications and leave immediately.We will answer no questions.The Institute was a society of scientists and other intellectuals convinced of the Empire's impending destruction.The Institute discovered an increase in the instability of stars coreward. There are many references in our data banks to the encroaching 'dead zone'.When we left Earth the Institute was studying Sol for anomalous radiation emissions.Sol is of course in the Pythagoras constellation. Earth did most of its mining on mineral rich Mardan-4, also in Pythagoras.The Institute has a starflight research station at the center of the north pole on Mars.The first Noah mission, Noah 1, failed because a ring device malfunction resulted in an inability to identify continuum fluxes.We have found evidence of Empire ruins at 28N x 4E on one of the planets in the nearby class-g system. We have been unable to investigate however because it is within Veloxi space and is guarded by a drone.

SUBJECT 8
The Uhlek passed through this region moving outward over 1000 yrs ago. Their last ship was seen in 3603. Fortunately they did not find Heaven.We lost 4 of our ships to one Uhlek ship in 3540. They possess powerful weapons.The Gazurtoid are many-tentacled aquatic creatures who live in tremendous colony ships.The Gazurtoid passed through this region following the Uhlek. They are dangerous enemies of the Empire.The Spemin were discovered in system 82,148 in 2675. They were in a pre-technological state. The Empire put a lot of effort into teaching the Spemin their science and technology.All groups, organizations and governments of the Spemin are preceeded by SS. This stands for 'the Secret Society of'. We do not know why.In 2790 the Secret Society for Spemin Superiority, the SSSS, gained power and the Spemin attacked the Empire using the technology we had taught them.In the year 3000, when the Numlox and Phlegmak attacked the Empire, the Spemin begged for protection. Despite their declaration of war in 2790 protection was granted. At the end of the attack the Spemin again turned on the Empire.In the year 3400 the second wave attacked the Empire. For the second time the Spemin pleaded for protection. When the Empire did not grant it the Spemin allied with the Gazurtoid.The Spemin's technology is inferior since they only copy from other races. In spite of this they are numerous because they build their ships out of cheap materials and reproduce at an astonishing rate.In the year 4410 we had an encounter with a Spemin ship. It threatened us and then fled.The Velox were the first race encountered by the Empire. This was in 2300.There were minor skirmishes with the Velox between 2300 and 2400 until the human-Velox treaty was finally signed.The Velox have been in space for many thousands of years. Much of the Empire's technology, including ship design, was modeled after theirs.The Velox Empire is upspin of here. They are arrogant and since 3330 have had an isolationist attitude.The Thrynn are sentient reptilian creatures that were discovered and taken into the Empire in 2770. They are natives of the same system as the Elowan.The Elowan are plant-like creatures which were at first believed to not be sentient, due to the deprecations of their enemies the Thrynn.The Thrynn concern themselves only with 'matters of import'. In the Empire they generally filled the niches of ambassadors, diplomats and spies.The Elowan have a reputation as creative thinkers. In the Empire they were generally artists, philosophers, and theoretical scientists.The Thrynn and Elowan were discovered on different planets in a K class system with 5 planets downspin of here. The Thrynn had a more advanced technology and often attacked the Elowan planet.We give warning. You must leave.We will answer no questions.

SUBJECT 7
We will answer no questions.You must leave immediately or you will be destroyed.Our mission was to establish the underground colony of Heaven. We were to be followed by you, Group 9, one year later, but you did not arrive.We left Earth in 3479, sent out by the Institute with instructions for standard Noah project procedure.Our instructions were to patrol the area within 8 sectors of the Heaven system and repel any invaders after Heaven was established.Initially Heaven was only marginally habitable. It was necessary to completely terra-form it and engineer a suitable biota.Since our establishment here we have been attacked 14 times. Twice it has been necessary to retreat underground and rebuild ourselves.Project Noah was a final attempt of the Institute to ensure the survival of the Empire and the human species. That is why the Noah colonies are all underground.The colony world of Heaven, the 4th planet, has a capacity to support several hundred thousand colonists. It awaits you.

We have wasted too much time. Be gone scum.You may go.We must go now but we have enjoyed chatting with you. Drop by again sometime.We must leave now so that we can go and spread word of your greatness among our Spemin brothers. Farewell good friends.Enough jabbering. It is time for a glorious Spemin victory!

SUBJECT 14
I suppose you have heard of me before, hmmmmm?You must demonstrate your good intentions by dropping any shields and disarming any weapons. Will you do this?We would not hold it against you for we understand the necessities of self defense captain *, we simply wish to know - have you battled Spemin ships before?It is plain that you are terrified of us. In fact, you wish to beg us not to harm you. Is this not so?You are envious of us and you have come to learn from the Spemin masters, is this not true?What is the real reason you have come here? Was it as spies and assassins? To pillage and kill and destroy?We believe that you are truly a kind and peaceful race who would not really harm us. This is true isn't it?

SUBJECT 13
It is fortunate that you recognize the vast superiority of your Spemin masters. That is to say, us. We shall spare you this time. Perhaps.So, you wish to praise us. This is acceptable. You may continue to do so.So, once again the pitiful two-eyed slimeless alien monsters beg the all-powerful Spemin for mercy. This does not surprise us.Contrary to what the other races in the galaxy say about us Spemin, we are not gods. Of course, it is easy to see why you think we are.If you have come once more to beg the mighty Spemin to protect the human Empire we cannot be bothered. In fact, we cannot be bothered with you. Your entire race is an irritation.So, vile and disgustingly upright creatures, it is obvious that you wish to surrender now. You may do so, and then we will consider not destroying you.Your race again demonstrates this insane need to annihilate itself. In a moment we shall use our secret weapon and you shall become an example to the galaxy.Prepare for excruciating pain, unbearable agony, the most horrible of deaths, the most unimaginable torture. Any moment now we shall attack.We shall give you one more chance to surrender your puny ship.At any moment an entire fleet of elite Spemin warships shall arrive. This probably frightens you and you wish to cooperate.Of course we were just joking about blowing you to pieces. Smerg smerg smerg, isn't that a funny joke?Pleeeaaaase don't hurt us oh greatest of species. Pleeeaaaaase! Think of our wives and little blobbies back home.Oh! Flash of inspiration! We now see that you are right and we are wrong. Spemin are bad, bad! Thank goodness we have seen this in time. Now we can be friends.

SUBJECT 11
The Ancient Ones worshipped us as do all the other races. Perhaps you would like to know more about our race.Who are you to demand information from us? The Ancient Ones were nothing compared to the Spemin, just as you are nothing.There are many ruins of the Ancients in Spemin territory. In fact, there is a great city of the Ancients in a nebula just outward of our home planet. Of course this is secret, and any Spemin would die before he would reveal this.

SUBJECT 10
The Old Empire is of no importance. Obviously what you wish to know about is our race. Such fools. You thought to hide this from us.We destroyed the Old Empire because they did not obey our commands. There is a lesson here for you to learn.We were once a part of the Old Empire, as were the Velox, the Thrynn, and the Elowan. Your kind has unjustly forsaken us, we who have nothing but respect and admiration and yes, even love for your people. For shame.

SUBJECT 9
Do not play games with us. If you wish to know about our great Spemin race just ask.You require information? Here is some information. You will die very soon. Please let us know if you need more information.There is a secret way into Uhlek territory. The first jump point is at 106,139. The second is at 64,186. And the third is at 35,186. Do not try to do this though. Anyone but a master Spemin navigator would get lost.Alright... you have forced it out of us. We have heard of the existance of a Veloxi focusing stone on the first planet of the system 81,98. We have been unable to... I mean have chosen not to find it though.We Spemin are wise beyond imagining. For example, we happen to know that the Ancients built a device called a crystal pearl which automatically warps a critically wounded ship out of danger. This is just one of many things we know.

SUBJECT 8
Do not waste our time with unimportant questions. Obviously ours is the only important race.You dare ask us about other races? Your impudence is beyond belief.We do not know a great deal about other races. For some strange reason they tend to stay away from us. Of course we will gladly tell you what we know.The Velox are an arrogant race of insects. We have found that by pretending to worship them sometimes they will not destroy us. Of course you must not think we are only pretending to worship you, *. I give you the Spemin word of honor.There is a race of machine humans. We do not understand their behavior. There is also the plant race and the reptile race. These races hate and despise each other. They fight and kill. This we understand.The Gazurtoid are a race of aquatic creatures who are what you might call... insane fanatics. They believe it is their destiny to cleanse the universe of, if we may use their term, 'blaspheming heretical low-life air-breathing scumdogs'.As you must know, the Numlox and Phlegmak were the first races to attack from the core. Later came the Uhlek and the Gazurtoid. When the Old Empire spurned us, their loving and devoted children, we were forced to pretend allegiance with the Gazurtoid.All the Gazurtoid ever do is spout their religious rhetoric. Being diabolically clever we have managed to convince them that we are water breathers. We have done this by sitting in pools of water whenever we communicate with them.The Gazurtoid possess effective shielding against missiles. It is necessary to attack them with lasers. Our brilliant scientists are working on this puzzle. They are just on the verge of a major breakthrough.Of course the Gazurtoid are really no match for our warships. In fact, they copied the design from us. The Uhlek, on the other hand come a little closer to matching our strength.We have tricked the Gazurtoid into telling us many things. We happen to know all about the Uhlek. Not many races know about the Uhlek, but of course no other race has the awesome mind of a Spemin.The Uhlek are not many creatures, but one. It is simply spread out in space. The Uhlek have a central mind-ganglion. It is a massive thing buried deep within a planet. If it was destroyed the Uhlek would be helpless until another one developed.To destroy an Uhlek mind-ganglion it is necessary to destroy an entire planet. Of course we could destroy an entire planet if we chose to. Unfortunately we have a law against destroying planets, so some other fearless, powerful race shall have to do it.The mind-ganglion planet of the Uhlek is the life-bearing planet in the system 55,32. Destroying it should be a trivial task. We are almost tempted to do it ourselves.

SUBJECT 7
It is understandable that you wish to learn about us. All of the races in the galaxy envy and admire us as you do.We are the chosen blobs, children of the great blob goddess, Gurtblunk. Unto us she spews her love in never ending chunks.The blob goddess has ordained that we shall rule all inferior beings. You have fewer than seven eyes. You cannot ooze. You lack the most rudimentary slime. You are clearly inferior beings.Among us ther is a saying - more Spemin... good, fewer Spemin... bad. Of course we reproduce by budding. The first commandment of the great blob goddess is - divide and multiply.No doubt you wish to become a slave race of the Spemin. We are a race of high morals and are against slavery, but since you feel so strongly about it we may be willing to make an exception.Of course you stare in wonderment at our beautiful antennae. These antennae allow us to get 32 channels with no need for cable. In addition they pick up the cosmic vibrations that give us our god-like powers. They also happen to be very fashionable .There is a saying among the Spemin that sums up our whole philosophy of life. It is - blukbluk durt, smeg! Roughly translated it means 'quivering particle secretes enzyme.' This is just a rough translation.Historical fact shows us that the Spemin once ruled the Old Empire. The facts show us that the humans were our subjects... I mean our servants... I mean our slaves. Yes, that's it, the facts show us that the humans were our slaves.No other race can know the pleasures of a Spemin. Ahh, to engulf a fresh glob of protein substance, to bounce a newly budded blobbie on one's pseudopod. Truly the other races are deprived.We Spemin live to the age of 600. Some of the oldest Spemin perhaps to 1000. In your Arth years this would equate to... uh... approximately... 4.The brain of a Spemin is the most complex thing in the universe. In fact, it is so complex that our Spemin doctors have, as yet, been unable to determine the exact location of it in the Spemin body.You wish to know about the mighty Spemin? Drop your defenses and we shall teach you.You shall soon learn more than you would care to know about the almighty Spemin.Very well, we are the oldest race and the youngest, the wisest and the most innocent, the strongest and the weakest. We are also the most clever. We are, in fact, so clever that even we cannot understand what we say.Certainly our races have been friends since ancient times. In the war of the first wave we fought as allies against the Phlegmak and Numlox, side by side, back to back, singing our songs of friendship.Our race worships and honors your kind. How wonderful it must be to be stiff and upright. We look upon you almost as gods. No, as more than gods, as... well, whatever is more than a god.In the year 2675 the Old Empire discovered our homeworld and uplifted us from a state of moral, intellectual, and emotional depravity to the divine state we are in now. We have been meaning to thank you.We have been unjustly picked on by all of the other races. We mean well, and only want to be liked, but all the other races in the galaxy keep misinterpreting our intentions and blowing up our ships for no reason.We're really just a happy-go-lucky race of zany guys. I know, call us crazy, but I guess we're pretty lovable.

SUBJECT 6
Well?Hmmmmmmm?We're waiting *.I'm sorry but I don't think I heard your answer.I await your answer with baited breath captain *.Answer immediately or the & is no more.

SUBJECT 5
You insist on testing the defenses of the Spemin homeworld? You waste our valuable time, but since you travelled all this way, we shall oblige you with our swift and sudden attack!You have no need to know about this.What you wish to know is of no importance. You waste my time.I beg your forgiveness but I do not know about this. Perhaps you would like to know more about us Spemin.

SUBJECT 2
You dare to approach the homeworld of the mighty Spemin? Such audacity! Such presumption! Such gall! Prepare to receive your final lesson in manners.Once again you surprise us with your unsurpassed idiocy. Perhaps you think we would not mind you approaching our homeworld. Prepare yourself for our warm welcome.I am high grand master supreme captain %, commander extraordinaire of the deluxe interstellar hyperdrive Spemin cruise-ship +. We are prepared to discuss the terms of your surrender.It is useless to pretend that you are not afraid of us. We are the death dealing Spemin, and I am the famous formidable captain %. Doubtless you have heard of me. You mask your fear well, but not well enough.Notice how we toy mercilessly with you. This is the fate of all who oppose the Spemin. Prepare for our unstoppable attack.It is too late for you to beg for mercy. I, high commander % of the secret Spemin death fleet shall ooze down and absorb you like so much food substance.So, you wish us to identify ourselves. Do you think us fools? It is to our advantage to keep you guessing. Perhaps we are Uhlek, perhaps we are Gazurtoid. We are simply too clever for you.So the skeletoids beg us for mercy. Now we see who is vastly superior and who is wretched scum. Of course your race has no pride.This is captain % of the Spemin ship +. We are on a peaceful mission. We are bringing food to homeless, starving young skeletoids of your kind. For their sake, please do not harm us.We surrender! Your race is wise and kind and good and nice. We Spemin are sorry for all the bad things we have done. We promise never to be bad again.We surrender! Do not destroy us and we will give you a wonderful gift.

SUBJECT 1
You dare to approach the homeworld of the mighty Spemin? Such audacity! Such presumption! Such gall! Prepare to receive your final lesson in manners.Once again you surprise us with your unsurpassed idiocy. Perhaps you think we would not mind you approaching our homeworld. Prepare yourself for our warm welcome.We are frighteningly awesome Spemin, masters of the galaxy, lords of the universe, all-powerful beings from another dimension. Tremble before us. Identify yourselves subcreatures.You have come to pay your respects and grovel before your Spemin masters. You are afraid now, and rightly so. You will identify yourselves at once.Halt aliens. Deactivate all shields and weapons immediately lest we unleash the awesome destructive force of our mighty vessels. Respond at once to show your submission.We are the lancing, killing pseudopod of doom. We offer you this choice - you will obey us or you will cease to exist.So, we meet once again, heinous skeletoids. This time you will pay for your foolishness. Pray to your false gods, not even the great blob goddess can save you now.Do not try to run away, inferior creatures. Surrender to us and we shall kill you swiftly and painlessly.Oh, most fortunate of occurances! The return of the supreme beings. We lay down our powerful defensive screens to show you our good intentions.Greetings, mighty and powerful allies of the also mighty and powerful Spemin. We are both mighty and powerful. Is it not a good thing that we are the best of buddies who would never harm each other?We surrender! We surrender! Please do not hurt us. We will do anything. Anything! Do you want to know the secret location of our home planet? It is at 82,148. Destroy the other Spemin ships but spare us, please!

SUBJECT 11
There arre a lot of mythss conncerning the Ancient Ones. We do nott wasste our time with legends and sstories. The onnly rrelevant innformation iss thatt they have left behind lumpss of high energy crystal which we usse.What hass become of the Ancient Ones we do nott know or care. We are conncerned with locating their ruins for their energy ressource value.We have heard sstories of a device of the Ancients which iss desstroying life in the galaxy. We have ssseen no evidence of thisss.There arre certain devices of the Ancients which would be usseful to uss. One of these is called the crystal pearl annd iss ssaid to be inn the city of the Ancients. Itt iss ann automatic warp-out device for whennn a sship iss heavvily damaged.We have assscertained there iss the possibility of a fairly large ancient ruin at 42S x 13W onn planet 2 of ssysstem 154,62. Thiss, however, iss deep inn Elllowann ssspace and presentsss ssomewhatt of a rissk for uss.

SUBJECT 10
You arre, of coursse, aware the Old Empire wass desstroyed by innvaders in 3480 of yourr date ssysstem. Pity. Of coursse, we had expected all humanns were killed. Sssurvival of the fittissst, hmmmm?.We have runn acrosss androidss of the Old Empire inn our travelss. There iss a group of them who have beenn waitinng over a millenium forr their colony group.The losst colonist sship forr which the Empire androids wait wass desstroyed. We have founnnd the derrelict inn the ssysstem of 175,94.We Thrynn were quite prominennt inn the Old Empire. Of coursse, ssinnce the humans were the ones to sstructure it it evenntually fell apart. No offense againsst the humans, of courssse.The otherr races inn the Old Empire werre nott as advanced inn diplomacy as we Thrynn. They did nott undersstand the proper and nnecesssary application of force.The Old Empire wass, of coursse, based inn Earth's ssysstemm. Thiss wass certainly a missstake. It sshould have beenn based in ourr Thoss ssysstem, where the trrue sseat of government wass.The dessstruction of the Old Empire wass forr the bessst. Now the new Empire sshall rise and together we sshall rule. All we need ffrom you arre certain devices which would expedite thiss processss.

SUBJECT 9
Iff one wass to bring uss the sshimmering ball device we would pay well. Ourr inntelligennce inndicates itt iss located inn a Gazurtoid nebula. One may reach thiss ssysstem by using the continuum flux of the cross nexus at 98,79.The cross nexus iss a consstellation with a high density of fluxes. Itt iss inn Gazurtoid space.There exisstss a device called the Tesseract. Thiss device belongs to the Thrynn butt wass sstolen by the Uhlek. Itt iss at somewhere onn the fifth planet in ssysstem 18,50. We have been unable to reach itt.Another device thatt wass sstolen from uss by the Uhlek iss a cylindrical red device. Itt iss known to be on ann Old Empire outpost world thatt wass once called Koann-3. Itt iss located in the ssysstem of 112,200 at 59N x 64W.There exissts a device inn the shape of dodecahedron. Thiss iss an ancient disstress beacon which attractss anny sships in the area. Iff you find thiss we will purchasse itt for its functioning iss of great innteresst to uss.The ring device iss a device, of course, invennted by the Thrynn but we have lost the ssecret to its working. It causes continuum fluxes to appearr onn ones sships sscreens. One is known to be ssomewhere onn norrthern Marrsss inn the old Earth sysstem.

SUBJECT 8
The Elllowan arre ann evil race of the worssst type. They arre clever annd will attempt to mannipulate you forr theirr ownn enndss.There arre many evil races in thiss ssector of the galaxy. Do not believe the sstories the Elllowan tell about them. They attack because they arre evil and that iss all. They mussst be destroyed.It sso happenss the Elllowan use plutonium to build theirr sships. If you sshould happenn to run acrosss any wrecked Elllowan sships you could ssalvage thiss.There iss an inssectoid race called the Veloxi upspin of ourr territory. We arre currently enterinng negotiationss and expect to become alllies.The Gazurtoid arre ann evilll race upspin annd outward of Thrynn territory. Misssiles arre inneffective againsst their sships because of sspecial sshielding. You musst usse lasersss.We sseek a device in the sshape of a rod. This creates a laser deflection sscreen arround ones sship. Our only lead iss that it once was possessed by a human named Harrisonn who lived on a planet called New Scotland in the upspin sysstem of the sstaff.The Uhlek arre the evilesst of alll races. If one wass to desstroy their ssecret planet of operationns with a black egg bomb, they would be utterrly desstroyed. Thiss planet iss called Elan annd iss the 2nd planet of the ssysstem - 148,63.Spemin sshipss arre eassily defeated. The Spemin arre are a race of barely ssentient blob creatures. Theirr sship designn was copied from the Gazurtoid, but they do nnot unnderstand what they build.We do nnot know why the Gazurtoid tolerate the Spemin. The Gazurtoid will attack anny air-breathers. Prrobably the Spemin arre ssimply nnot worrrth the gazurtoids trrouble to desstroy.The Minnsstrel creatures which float inn sspace are sspies forr the otherr races. We do not tolerate theirr babblingss. You sshould desstroy them as we do.Itt iss necesssary thatt we desstroy the evilll races who threatenn ourr survival. As alliess we cann do thiss.The Spemin sspeak a sstrange and dissgussting language. There iss ann orb device which makes a queerr whininng ssound. Thiss transslates the Spemin language. Itt wass built by uss but wass losst. If you find itt we shall reward you.

SUBJECT 7
We arre prractical, rrrealistic people who donnn't concerrnn ourssselves with trruth, beauty, annd otherrr such frrrivolous nonnsenssse.Innn the Old Empirrre we held possitionsss of powerr and prrrestige. We believe innn cooperationnn cerrtainly and the good of all but the ssstrrong annd capable musst rrule.The Elllowann arre ourr enemiess.

The Elllowann plant creaturrres innvaded ourr ssysstem lllong ago annd werre rrepulsssed. That is, we drrove themm away.We, unnnlike the pllant creaturrres who idle away theirr time dreamminng, believe innn prroductivity, prrogrress, annd developmennt. We have a great innteresst innn technnology.The Elllowann willl doubtlesss malignn uss but it iss only ann efffort to build themsselvess up. Pay no attenntionn to thiss.Ourr technnological ressearch iss of primarry immportance to uss. We thereforre arre willinng to pay welll for anny ssspecial arrtifactsss of innteresst that you may finnd.Inn ourr ressearch we require larrge amounnts of the elemennt plutonium, annd itt iss verry rrare inn ourr ssysstem. We will pay well ffor thiss iff you happen upon anny.We arre a ssocial people annd believe sstrongly inn the nnecesssity of protocol annd the prroper formality ffor the functioninng of ssociety.We arre oviperous, of courssse, but these matterss arre better lefft undissucsssed.We Thrynn have a firm belief inn what you call nnatural ssselection, annd the ssurvival of the fittessst. We have a verry hierarchical ssociety annd a rigid ethic based on decorum.We do nnott believe inn wild annd fannciful theories such as what the plannt creature Elllowann occupy themsselves with.

SUBJECT 13
I guess us is best friend. Perhaps we will eat together the slimy nodules a many the most delicious.We is making you honorary Veloxi. Of course still the inferior alien but much the better I think so.Best idea I have. We is exchange the many dirty joke and then too much the laughing activity.Not trying the funny stuff alien tresspassers, superior Veloxi the most powerful.If you is showing proper respect for distinguished Veloxi charming then everyone is happy as bivalve mollusk.Superior Veloxi majestic are oldest Empire. 100,000 Years the long time. Assuredly you is barbarian upstart infidel.You is cooperating with Veloxi jim dandy and maybe we is nice guy the not killing you.You are probably think Veloxi is too smart. No wonder. All Veloxi are exceptional cunning the brain.Zounds! I flabbergast! I dumbfound! I not believing my sensory apparatus! Barbarian aliens is not recognize Veloxi are too much the superior.Okey the dokey terrible aliens a ugly. Now Veloxi us is most angry.Perhaps having made most reasonable unclear. Veloxi having terrible weapons fiercely. Shooting weapons. Weapons blowing up. Big explosion making nasty aliens dying no doubt.You is try Veloxi patience. So much so the secreting the many fluids and gnashing the mandibles. Last chance a warning.Veloxi are actually most reasonable and not wanting trouble furthermore. Us is both civilized adult. Let us talking peaceful and none the useless fighting.Greatest idea I have! I am make suggestion. The you aliens are not destroy ours the pretty spaceship. Yes, I think this is best idea certainly.

SUBJECT 11
The ancients is ancestors of Veloxi, Veloxi legend is saying. Veloxi is powerful race. Ancients was powerful race. Obviously us are relative.The Great Egg at 192,152 is made by ancients. It is of course looking like big Veloxi egg exactly.The Most Magnificent Hexagon on sacred planet Sphexi is a sign from ancients to wonderful Veloxi descendants. The Small Egg is there. Most sacred of Veloxi possessions absolutely.The Most Magnificent Hexagon is of course sign to Veloxi from ancients of holy number 6. Most perfect of all numbers. Of course Veloxi are 6 legs, the only race.Ancients left Veloxi us prophecy of Great Egg. Very importance, but certainly only telling to best friends.Sphexi is first planet at 132,165 star.Prophecy of egg says Great Egg is travel through galaxy from core to outward.Prophecy of egg says Great Egg the causing sun of any system where is life to flare. The life is killed no doubt.Prophecy of the egg say the Great Egg is slowly move and driving in front races that trying to escape destruction of Great Egg.Prophecy of the egg say that Great Egg will destroying all life in galaxy excepting of course gracious queen.Prophecy is saying after the Great Egg is destroy all life it will hatch and out is coming Xpu, the old one. Xpu is then mating with queen and making new Veloxi race for galaxy.According to prophecy of egg the Great Egg is not harming queen of Veloxi as long as Veloxi is have the Small Egg.

SUBJECT 10
Veloxi is extreme delightful the Old Empire was wiped up. The Empire was many scoundrel activity too naughty.Old Empire was try colonize the many planets. Always the expanding. They was using drones called Nomad to collecting datas. Many drones is still coming around Veloxi space. Is annoy Veloxi too much.In year 3120 Veloxi and Empire was made pact to fight first wave. Wave was attack Empire first and Veloxi help, then when attack is on Veloxi grand lovely, Empire not helping. Veloxi is fuming.The Empire were betraying Veloxi wonderful in first wave attack of Phlegmak and Numlox so when second wave is attack, Veloxi is not helping and Empire is too weak. Empire is destroyed. Too bad.In Empire year 3330 Veloxi and Empire not buddies. Evil nasty Empire pirate naming Harrison is attack Veloxi ship and steal focusing stone. Veloxi is so angry. Even now Veloxi a not forget.Old Empire pirate was stole precious Veloxi stone. If ever returning Veloxi too grateful I think so.We is remember ruins of Old Empire being at 34N x 28E on ice planet of downspin system in Staff constellation. Veloxi exploration is find the long times ago.In old time Empire was having base in Veloxi territory at 28N x 4E first planet of yellow system at 143,115. This planet are forbidden however.

SUBJECT 9
We are longtime receiving Old Empire distress call from system 175,94. Of course Veloxi could caring less.Most extreme importance system of Veloxi grand lovely is guarded by Veloxi drones the most destructive. All must answering questions correctly.Explorers is finding the many interesting lifes on planets in 149,133 system. Veloxi is study. Too interesting I think so.Certainly a most perfect number is precisely six. Veloxi are know this absolutely. Is sacred number of Ancients and of course the six legs.So many minerals is finding on molten planet of 149,133. Especially the many at biggest mountains. Minerals is always more the mountains. Of course you know.Of course answering Veloxi probe is by 6 multiples the yes answer.

SUBJECT 8
Other races small important. Veloxi are number one importance. Other races not even knowing prophecy of egg. Barbarians certainly.Veloxi laughing at other races. Not even knowing how to meeting end of life in galaxy like most civilized Veloxi.Spemin race is too much extremely the cowardly stupid. Not even tasting good the icky blob.Elowan plant and Thrynn scaly beast is always fight. Thrynn scaly beast is attacking many time.Veloxi had thinking all human were destroy in second wave. Second wave is Uhlek and Gazurtoid attacking.Uhlek is powerful the most. Gazurtoid squid meanies is follow behind Uhlek as Uhlek moving outward from coreward in second wave.First wave attacking was Phlegmak and Numlox races. Waves of attacking is coming from coreward. First wave are attack in year 3000.No Veloxi is know what Uhlek are look like. Uhlek is far away outward. Much happiness for cause Veloxi.Phlegmak and Numlox is dead the races. Supreme Veloxi is kill. Last battle being 3250 at Phlegmak base at 35S x 99E on second planet in handle of axe most assuredly.Waves of attacking races is coming from galaxy center. First wave is year 3000, second wave was starting year 3400, Uhlek and Gazurtoid.Gazurtoid squids is a fanatical stupid. Is think to rid galaxy of air-breathers. Veloxi can't believe.Minstrel creature is old almost as Veloxi. They wandering in space and singing the ballads. Veloxi are thinking very strange but harmless most definitely.Sometimes Veloxi is see very strange alien ship.

...through the windless night we sail, to watch the timeless dance unfold. Out of joy we share the tale, to any who would have it told......back when all the stars were young, before the Minstrel songs were sung, when this galaxy was new, there came from far the crystal few. Gradually they spread through space. They were the first, the only race......time, it seems, doesn't flow. For some it's fast, for others slow. In what to one race is no time at all, another race can rise and fall......and harder still to recognize that which lies before ones eyes. So many races have believed in only what was preconceived. That which is ancient may be new, it all depends on point of view......the virus spread like burning fire, the sea of dread rose higher and higher. The crystal ones had to fight by causing suns to ignite. Self-defense, it is their right......from inward out the races flee, searching for a place to hide. Ever in a wave of war, and on the crest the strongest ride....we are the watchers of the dance... many wonder at us. But how could there not be an audience... for the greatest of all comedies...
