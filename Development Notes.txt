Need to fix after taking screenshots:

Star 13 orbit position 4 row might need to be moved up
Star 23 missing row for liquid planet (orbit position 4)
Star 32 missing row for the one planet it has
Star 36 missing the rock planet in the second orbit number

Star 77 outermost planet has weather as "Light" ?!?

Notes on FP precision and universe scale in hyperspace:
Unity range is -32768 to +32767 due to FP precision
SF universe is 250 x 220 - let's call it 256 x 256.
65536 / 256 = 256 Unity units per game unit.
In SF 8 taps = 1 unit.
Size of ship is roughly 1 tap in hyperspace.
So ship should be 256 / 8 or 32 units in size in hyperspace.
Stars are roughly 2 to 4 units in SF in hyperspace.
So stars should be between 64 to 128 units.
Center is at 125 x 110.
Conversion formula is ( X - 125 ) x 256, ( Y - 110 ) x 256
