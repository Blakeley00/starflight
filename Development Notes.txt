Need to fix after taking screenshots:

Star 13 orbit position 4 row might need to be moved up
Star 23 missing row for liquid planet (orbit position 4)
Star 32 missing row for the one planet it has
Star 36 missing the rock planet in the second orbit number

Star 77 outermost planet has weather as "Light" ?!?
