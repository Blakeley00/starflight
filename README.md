# Starflight

Starflight: The remaking of a legend.

This project's goal is to remaster Starflight, taking inspiration from the CGA and EGA versions of the game. The finished game will have all of the features of those versions.

We are using Unity, with no external libraries. The main project is in the "Starflight" folder, and it is using [this version of Unity](https://github.com/mherbold/starflight/blob/master/Starflight/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt). You can download Unity for free from their website, or using the new [Unity Hub](https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-hub-release-candidate-0-20-1-is-now-available.546315/) app to manage versions.

The "Research" folder contains information about the original CGA and EGA versions of the game, and is where we pull inspiration from.
