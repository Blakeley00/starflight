      "m_message": "You are about to embark on your first mission.  In your bank account you will find the amount of 12,000 monetary units (M.U.).  This money is to be spent training your crew, configuring your ship, and purchasing any necessary materials.\nOf course you may wish to leave some portion of this in the bank to earn interest.  This is acceptable.  At this stage of the operation our primary goal is to gather information.  Consequently, your objectives are -\n    1. Seek out and explore strange new worlds\n    2. Boldly go where no man has gone before\n    3. Establish contact with any sentients\n    4. Capture and bring back non-sentient lifeforms\n    5. Record alien lifeform data\n    6. Bring back alien artifacts\n    7. Bring back any valuable minerals (including endurium)\n    8. Keep from getting brutally killed\nWe have little information to offer concerning what you might find.  We suggest however, that you avoid the area of space around the coordinates 135, 84 since that is where we lost contact with two of our earlier ships.\nScout reports indicate a high density of minerals in the mountainous regions of the innermost planet of our system.\nFurther, we have found information that leads us to believe that there may be some ruins of the old empire at coordinates 17N x 162E on the second planet of the neighboring K-class system.\nWe have also received some indication of alien activity in the system 175, 94.\nGood luck, and a safe return."

You may have been aware that for the last several years scientists have been observing anomalous fluctuations in the radiation levels of our sun.\nWhile you have been away it has been ascertained that the stability of our sun is definitely deteriorating.  How much time we have until there is a fatally large flare, we are still not sure, but there is little doubt that this will eventually occur.\nAs yet, we have no clue as to the cause of this instability.  Therefore, we must assume there is nothing we can do to change the situation.  In view of this the only option available to us is to get as many colonists off of arth as we can.\nYou can be invaluable to us in this.  First we need endurium to power the ships we will build.  We will pay well for any that you can bring back.  Secondly, we need to know where to send the colonists.\nAs you may have already discovered, your ship is equipped with homing drones which you may use to log your recommendations.  This is so that we can move the colonists out as quickly as possible.\nIn addition, a sensor has been installed which will inform you of the stellar condition upon entering a system.  Your ship computer will inform you in the event that a flare is imminent.\nWe advise caution while in systems which are more than slightly unstable.  Being caught in a solar flare would certainly be fatal.\nIn your manual we have outlined the criteria which will be important in your evaluation of viable colony worlds.  You will be rewarded for recommendations of valuable planets and penalized recommendations of planets which turn out to be uninhabitable.\nConsider carefully before logging a planet."
